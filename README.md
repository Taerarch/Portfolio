# Portfolio

##Style
I didn't want to be overly complicated with my design as it quite honestly isn't me. I think it's also important to have clarity and dare I say elegance in the design. For actual products I'd want more beautification to increase user interest and excitement.

##Technology
I decided to use the construction of my portfolio for a bit of practice with Bootstrap as I'd never really used it in any of my course projects and then React to build more comfort with hooks. React also turned out to be very helpful for rearranging elements and constructing the project transitions. Implementing bootstrap wasn't difficult however I feel like I might not be using it to it's full potential, I mostly used it arranging my layout with columns as well as creating cards for styling.


I integrated some feedback from General Assembly Alumni to not display my contact details as easy access for ne'er do wells and to add the information on mouse over for the various technology logos.
