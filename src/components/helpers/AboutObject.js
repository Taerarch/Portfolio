      "As a recent graduate from General Assembly Software Immersive, I'm looking to initiate a career as a Full-Stack Developer. Before studying software I completed an Arts Science degree at USYD with a major in Psychology in 2018. In my latest years of University I discovered my passion for Formal Logic having already decided not to pursue a career in Psychology and that led to my studies in Coding."

I became quite comfortable using Ruby and Rails during my first major project and it's the back-end setup I'm most comfortable with. I've also implemented Firebase for the back-end and hosting during my last two projects."
